# SOEN6611_Project on Stack Overflow

Abstract: Stack Overflow accumulates an enormous amount of software engineering knowledge on different kinds of programming languages and programming related topics over the last decade. However, at the beginning of the years of the stack overflow community users were so much active, but over the years the activities of the users have been decreased significantly. Similarly, the number of posted questions and answers are also declining in the similar trend over the years on stack overflow. In this paper, we investigate the rise and fall of stack overflow over the years through two RQs. We found that: 1) the number of answers and users activity on stack overflow is decreasing drastically, although users are posting questions. Therefore, huge numbers of questions remain unanswered over the years. 2) Users are frequently changing the topics on Stack Overflow due to the popularity of the tags or programming language.
